### Summary
Immune responses in the lung are essential for preventing and controlling a wide range of infections. Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells are critical for frontline immunityâ€”yet in the murine lung they undergo rapid attrition to preserve gas exchange, accumulating in the draining lymph nodes (LLN) for resupply through retrograde migration. Whether this paradigm applies to humans is currently unknown. Here, we present the first comprehensive analysis of T cells from human lung and its LLN, defining the prevalence and properties of lung TRM cells specific to a broad spectrum of pathogens. Using a T-cell receptor (TCR)-guided approach that integrates single-cell transcriptomics with paired TCR repertoire profiling, we mapped the pathogen-specificity of over 87,000 lung T cells from 40 individuals, the majority of whom harbored TRM cell populations specific to multiple viruses. Thus, in contrast to mice, the human lung itself serves as a reservoir of clonally-expanded TRM cells specific to a broad spectrum of pathogens. Although the LLN contained a small population of TRM cells, over 80% of the TCRs from highly expanded TRM clones in the lung were absent in the LLN, suggesting that they do not serve as the major reservoir for lung TRM cells. We also found that the prevalence and properties of pathogen-specific lung TRM cells are influenced more strongly by donor-intrinsic factors than pathogen identity. This suggests that the design of effective vaccines targeting airborne pathogens needs to account for host-intrinsic variability in the generation and maintenance of tissue-resident memory cells. Overall, our findings reveal that the human lung retains a stable and diverse pool of pathogen-specific TRM cells, suggesting that strategies to bolster these responses could provide durable protection against severe lung infections.
